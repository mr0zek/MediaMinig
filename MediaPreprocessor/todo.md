- remove empty folders from source after importing media
- groupping by event while moving pictures (Folder name "{DateFrom} - {Event.Name}") - events taken from json file
  {
    Events:{
      Event{
        Name : "Holidays Norway 2020",
        DateFrom : "2020-01-01",
        DateTo : "2020-02-01",
      },
      Event{
        Name : "Gramma birthday 2001"
        DateFrom : "2001-10-01",

    }
  }
